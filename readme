# LeetCode Problems Solutions

Welcome to the **LeetCode Problems Solutions** repository! This project is dedicated to solving LeetCode problems and sharing the solutions in an organized and structured manner.

## 📁 Project Structure

Each folder in this repository corresponds to a specific LeetCode problem. Inside every folder, you'll find:

1. **README.md**: Contains the problem description, example inputs/outputs, and other relevant details.
2. **solution.js**: The JavaScript file containing the solution to the problem.

### Example:
```
.
├── Problem-1
│   ├── README.md
│   └── solution.js
├── Problem-2
│   ├── README.md
│   └── solution.js
└── ...
```

## 🚀 How It Works
